test file for clone
while working in the folder where you have cloned the repo, you dont have to again use remote add origin "<URL>" command because it already knows where
to go
This is me trying to edit this file in github and see what happens to the file content of 4.txt in my local repo. 
The changes will not be applied to the local repo but once you pull the repo from github, the changes will be applied to your local repo
