This is a test file to see how stash works. Let's take an example to understand why we need stash?
Example: First, I create a new file in my test branch. Next, type ls and see that new file is being shown in the list of files. Next, I switch to master
branch and type ls, I can see the new file in master also. I switch to test branch again and then type git add . 
I type ls again and I can still see the new file in the list of files. I switch to master and type ls, I still see the new file in the list of files. 

This is extremely concerning because we dont want one branch to interfere with other branch. That's why we use stage. We type git stash in the test
branch. This saves our work without committing and we can switch to master branch now without any concern. The new file wont be reflected in master.
I do my work in master and switch to test branch. Now when I do ls the new file wont be visible. To retreive our previous working state we use:
git stash pop
This will return us to our previous working mode
