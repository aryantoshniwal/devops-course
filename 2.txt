hello from aryan

I am making changes to this file after creating 3.txt, but 3.txt is not being tracked currently
If i run git status now, I get this output:

On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   2.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        3.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
