This file has been created after running the command:git commit -m 'my first commit' 
This is a test file. Currently this file is not being tracked because I have only run the above commit command.
On running git status, I get the following output:
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        3.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
